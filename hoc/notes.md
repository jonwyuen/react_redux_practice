Higher Order Components - React component made to help us reuse code/reduce duplicate code

Component + HOC = Enhanced or Composed Component w/ additional functionality/data

4 steps:

2. create a HOC file and add HOC scaffold
3. move reusable logic into HOC
4. Pass props/config/behavior through to child component
